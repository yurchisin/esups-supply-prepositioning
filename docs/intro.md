# Welcome to ESUPS Case Study

Enhancing Humanitarian Response with ESUPS and the STOCKHOLM Platform
In this comprehensive case study, learners will delve into the strategic and operational efforts of the Emergency Supply Pre-positioning Strategy (ESUPS), a collaborative working group consisting of Member States, NGOs, academics, UN agencies, and regional organizations, all operating within Welthungerhilfe. ESUPS plays a critical role in logistics preparedness and pre-positioning at both strategic and operational levels, aiming to optimize the pre-positioning of disaster relief items, minimize relief response times, and enhance the mapping and analysis of relief stock across global humanitarian organizations.
