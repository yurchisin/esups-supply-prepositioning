# The STOCKHOLM Platform

In this comprehensive case study, students will delve into the strategic and operational efforts of the Emergency Supply Pre-positioning Strategy (ESUPS), a collaborative working group consisting of Member States, NGOs, academics, UN agencies, and regional organizations, all operating within Welthungerhilfe. ESUPS plays a critical role in logistics preparedness and pre-positioning at both strategic and operational levels, aiming to optimize the pre-positioning of disaster relief items, minimize relief response times, and enhance the mapping and analysis of relief stock across global humanitarian organizations.

## Overview of ESUPS and STOCKHOLM:

ESUPS has developed an innovative platform called STOCKHOLM (STOCK of Humanitarian Organizations Logistics Mapping), which serves as a global central repository for relief stock data. This platform visually maps warehouse and supply locations, and provides an in-depth analysis that helps improve response times and supply coverage across diverse humanitarian crises.

### End-to-End Exploration of the Case Study:

#### 1.	Business Context and Story

This educational case study provides an in-depth exploration of the critical challenges ESUPS faces in managing the logistics of disaster relief at a global scale. The case begins by detailing the unique challenges and complexities of humanitarian logistics—such as unpredictable disaster locations, different relief needs, the need for centralized and standardized data, and the coordination of multiple stakeholders. 

Students will understand how ESUPS aims to address these challenges through a data-driven approach and the development of an optimized pre-positioning strategy that enhances global preparedness.


#### 2.	Optimization Model and Data Analytics

A key focus of this case study is the mathematical optimization model embedded within the STOCKHOLM platform. The study introduces students to the foundational principles of optimization, demonstrating how data analytics can be leveraged to make critical decisions about how much relief stock should be pre-positioned, and where. 

Students will be given a subset of anonymized, real-world data that mimics the inputs used by ESUPS to run their models, allowing them to explore hands-on the complexities involved in developing and implementing optimization models that drive impactful outcomes in humanitarian contexts.


#### 3.	Hands-on Learning with a Jupyter Notebook

To facilitate practical understanding, the case study includes a Jupyter Notebook, which guides students through the process of building, refining, and implementing an optimization model from scratch. This notebook serves as a step-by-step tutorial, from defining the problem and understanding the constraints to coding the solution and transitioning the model to a production environment. It also includes exploratory data analysis, model validation, and interpretation of the results, offering a holistic view of how data science and optimization techniques converge to solve real-world challenges.

#### 4.	Extending the Problem with Predictive Analytics

Beyond the current scope, the case study provides avenues for students to extend their exploration using predictive analytics techniques. For example, students could be tasked with predicting future demand for specific relief items based on historical data, seasonal patterns, or the nature of past disasters. This section encourages critical thinking about how predictive models could be integrated into STOCKHOLM to improve the forecasting and allocation of resources, further optimizing response strategies and minimizing waste.

#### 5.	Impact and Implementation Summary

The final section of the case study highlights the tangible impact of STOCKHOLM’s optimization capabilities on global humanitarian efforts. It outlines the real-world benefits observed, from reduced response times and lowered costs, to improved geographical coverage of relief supplies. 

Additionally, it provides a roadmap for implementation, detailing the steps required to scale the optimization model, handle larger datasets, and integrate advanced analytics tools. Students will gain insights into the practical challenges of transitioning from a prototype model to a fully operational tool used by humanitarian organizations worldwide.

### Positioning and Relevance

This case study is intended to offer a unique blend of strategic thinking, technical know-how, and real-world impact. It prepares learners not only to understand the complexities of humanitarian logistics, but also to build and deploy data-driven solutions that have the potential to save lives and streamline global response efforts in the face of natural disasters.

This case study is ideal for students and professionals interested in operations research, data science, and optimization for social good. It provides a practical, end-to-end learning experience that encompasses business strategy, mathematical modeling, data analytics, and the use of technology to solve some of the most pressing global challenges facing the world today.

### A Background on The Crisis that Prompted This Work: Disaster Relief & Mobilization Efforts

In 2015, Kathmandu, Nepal was devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that claimed approximately 9,000 lives and injured thousands more. The full extent of the tragedy became evident hours later, as over 600,000 buildings lay in ruins, including the nation’s central disaster relief supplies. Despite being only the 31st most affected area, Kathmandu housed around 90% of Nepal’s disaster relief resources, which were buried under the debris.

The international community quickly mobilized, with the UN raising nearly $330 million within two weeks to assist Nepal. While this rapid response showcased global solidarity and compassion, it also underscored a critical issue: the aid came after the disaster had struck. In disaster scenarios, the first 24 hours are crucial for rescue operations, as chances of finding survivors diminish significantly after that period. No amount of money can turn back those critical hours.

International responses, though well-intentioned, often face coordination challenges and logistical delays. The complexity of involving multiple organizations can lead to miscommunication and inefficiencies, making it difficult to ascertain what aid is coming and in what quantities. Studies indicate that roughly 60-80% of all disaster response costs are logistics-related, including stock pre-positioning and deployment. Knowing the location and availability of supplies is crucial to optimizing response efforts.
