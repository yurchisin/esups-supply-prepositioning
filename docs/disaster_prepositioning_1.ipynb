    "Enter ESUPS (Emergency Supply Pre-positioning Strategy). Founded in 2016, ESUPS emerged from the recognition that effective disaster response requires more than just post-disaster fundraising—it necessitates proactive, strategic planning and resource allocation. Initially launched as a collaborative effort among several NGOs, ESUPS aimed to tackle the very issues that hampered the Nepal earthquake response by creating a global database of pre-positioned supplies. This innovative initiative ensures that the nearest available resources are utilized first, enabling aid organizations to make informed decisions and address the most urgent needs swiftly.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESUPS started as a modest project, built on a simple spreadsheet that cataloged available disaster relief supplies across various regions. However, as the project gained traction and more organizations began contributing data, it became clear that a more sophisticated approach was needed. In response, ESUPS partnered with academic institutions like Penn State University and MIT, as well as industry leaders such as Gurobi, to develop advanced models for optimizing the allocation and movement of these supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of ESUPS’ early successes was the development of a simulation model that could identify the optimal locations for pre-positioning disaster relief supplies. This model proved instrumental in reducing response times and ensuring that critical resources reached disaster zones faster and more efficiently. Over time, ESUPS expanded its database to include hundreds of NGOs, each contributing data that made the system more robust and comprehensive. The impact of this collaborative effort was soon evident, as ESUPS’ models helped improve response times in several subsequent disaster scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 2020, ESUPS had grown into a globally recognized initiative, with its strategies being adopted by numerous international aid organizations. The project’s achievements include not only the development of cutting-edge optimization models but also the successful implementation of these models in real-world disaster scenarios. ESUPS has been credited with significantly enhancing the effectiveness of disaster relief efforts, saving lives, and reducing the costs associated with disaster response logistics."

    "Starting with the initial challenges faced by disaster relief organizations and the inefficiencies of traditional response methods, we will explore how ESUPS identified these gaps and developed a pioneering approach to pre-positioning resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will provide a detailed walkthrough of the optimization models that underpin ESUPS, offering a high-level explanation of the algorithms used and their practical applications. You’ll see how ESUPS has integrated real-world data into these models to make informed decisions that improve response times and potientally save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "-    **NOTE:** While ESUPS is operating at a global scale, the case study will focus on building a model for only one country: Madagascar. This reduction in scope allows us to more clearly walk learners through a smaller version of the problem, and leverage either our limited-size Gurobi license (available to all learners), or our full Gurobi academic license (available to all currently affiliated students, instructors, and researchers) to solve the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To deepen your understanding, the notebook includes practical exercises that allow you to engage directly with the concepts. You’ll encounter self-assessment multiple-choice questions and hands-on code implementation problems designed to reinforce your learning and give you the opportunity to experiment with optimization techniques. These exercises are crafted to help you build confidence in applying the concepts without the pressure of graded responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for those eager to dive deeper, the notebook features extension prompts that encourage you to think critically about how the underlying optimization problems could be adapted or expanded. These prompts are designed to challenge your creativity and problem-solving skills, enabling you to explore new ideas and potential improvements to the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll pull back the curtain to reveal the production code used by ESUPS, written by experts in the field. You’ll have the opportunity to examine real-world code implementations that drive ESUPS’ operations, gaining insight into the practical considerations and best practices for creating fast, reliable, and maintainable code. This section will also explore alternative approaches and the reasoning behind key decisions made in the development process, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how these algorithms transition from theoretical models to production-ready solutions.\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll have a solid grasp of how optimization, rather than machine learning, can be the most effective tool for solving complex logistical challenges, especially in high-stakes environments like disaster relief. You’ll also be equipped with the knowledge and practical skills to apply these techniques in your own projects, potentially making a significant impact in whatever field you choose to tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of ESUPS from a spreadsheet repository to a sophisticated data-driven solution highlights the importance of efficient disaster relief logistics. However, while technology has significantly improved our ability to manage and allocate resources, it also presents new challenges. The task of optimizing supply distribution in real-time amidst unpredictable disaster scenarios is not just a logistical issue, but a complex data science problem. So, let's dive into the technical challenges of prepositioning supplies together!\n"

    "For example, if you're trying to maximize your enjoyment by purchasing hotdogs and soda with a limited budget, you'd intuitively spend all your money, fully utilizing your budget constraint. The optimal solution occurs at the point where your spending exactly meets your budget limit—one of the vertices of the feasible region where the constraints are tight or binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of pre-positioning supplies for disaster response, each allocation affects the total transit time. The goal might be to meet demand with the minimum possible transit time, which requires allocating supplies so that the constraints are fully utilized—providing just enough to meet each warehouse's demand without surplus. This means the optimal solution will be at a vertex where the supply and demand constraints are exactly satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In transportation problems like ours, with whole-number supplies and demands, we're distributing indivisible units like buckets or hygiene kits. Since the suppliers have integer quantities to offer and the consumers require integer quantities to receive, the shipments must also be in whole numbers to exactly meet these needs. Fractional shipments wouldn't satisfy the exact integer requirements, nor would they make practical sense when items can't be divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, because the constraints are defined by integer values, the feasible region is a polyhedron whose vertices correspond to integer solutions. The Simplex Method, by moving along the edges of this integer-defined polyhedron, often arrives at integer solutions naturally. The constraints dictate that the total shipped from each supplier equals their supply and the total received by each consumer equals their demand, both of which are integers. This setup leads to shipment amounts that are integers because only whole units can satisfy both the supply and demand without leaving any fractions unaccounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers a clear advantage: instead of searching through a massive number of possible solutions within the feasible region—as might be necessary with other methods—the Simplex Method only needs to evaluate a finite number of vertices, one of which will be the optimal solution. In transportation problems with integer constraints, it often provides optimal integer solutions without the need for additional techniques like the Branch and Bound Method (read more about this in the Math Addendum). This makes the Simplex Method both effective and practical for scenarios where exact quantities are essential."

    "Optimization has taken a backseat with the rise of Machine Learning and Big Data. But if you think back to your courses, you’ll remember that both fields share many of the same mathematical roots. Many core ML concepts, like gradient descent, evolved from numerical optimization techniques like Newton’s method. I bring this up because, even though optimization might seem less flashy compared to the latest ML algorithms, it’s experiencing a resurgence. Recent advancements in solvers and algorithms have made optimization more powerful and easier to use, allowing it to tackle complex, large-scale problems that were previously out of reach. There are also many free educational resources available to get problem solvers up and running with optimization, making it more accessible than ever before—check out www.gurobi.com/learn for just some of the educational materials openly available to learners. All of this means it’s becoming an essential tool for decision-making in various industries, from logistics to finance.\n",
    "Just as an example, Gurobi, the most popular optimization model currently avalible, has seen a speed-up of 80% for problem like pre-positioning and has increased the solver's flexibility ~67% in the past 10 years \n",

    "MILPs are widely used in logistics and supply chain optimization. A real-world example is vehicle routing for delivery companies like UPS or FedEx, where the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled or delivery time while meeting constraints such as vehicle capacity, delivery time windows, and route restrictions. Advanced MILP solvers allow these companies to dynamically adjust routes in real-time, respond to traffic conditions, and make last-minute changes. This type of optimization is also critical in energy management, such as optimizing the scheduling of power generation plants to meet fluctuating demand while minimizing costs and adhering to regulatory and operational constraints.\n"

    "\n",
    "MIQPs find applications in financial portfolio optimization, where the goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. In this context, the quadratic term represents the risk (variance or covariance of asset returns), and the integer constraints can represent decisions like “buy or don’t buy” a particular asset or “fully divest from one sector.” Hedge funds and asset management firms use MIQP to optimize asset allocation, considering various market scenarios and investment constraints. The ability to handle complex quadratic relationships between variables makes MIQP suitable for any industry where risk management and trade-offs are involved, such as in optimizing communication networks and antenna placements."

    "\n",
    "MIQCPs are used in engineering design and manufacturing. An example is optimizing the layout of a factory floor or the design of an aircraft wing. The quadratic constraints might represent aerodynamic properties or stress limits, while integer variables can represent decisions like the number of machines or parts used. In the pharmaceutical industry, MIQCP can help optimize drug formulation processes by considering a wide range of constraints like stability, release rates, and production costs. The combination of integer and quadratic constraints allows for highly tailored solutions that can significantly reduce costs and improve performance in complex industrial systems."

    "In addition, optimization programs like Gurobi offer powerful tools such as pre-solve, which can significantly simplify models before they are solved. For instance, the country-level ESUPS model we’re working on would typically require 812 iterations of the simplex algorithm to reach a solution. However, with pre-solve enabled, it reduces that number to just one iteration! This kind of optimization not only saves time but also dramatically reduces computational costs.\n",

    "Imagine the impact if large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could suddenly use 23% fewer computational resources to train and run, or if their size could be reduced by two orders of magnitude while maintaining the same level of performance. This would save hundreds of millions of dollars and lead to a surge in locally hosted LLMs. Similarly, in the field of optimization, problems that were once considered too large or too complex to solve are becoming increasingly feasible each year.\n",

    "Just like machine learning algorithms, the mathematical foundations behind optimization techniques can be quite intricate and certainly justify the rigor of PhD programs. However, as with popular libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost, you don’t need to master all the underlying math to use these tools effectively—it’s more important to know how to set up the problem correctly.\n",

    "For the rest of this notebook, we’ll focus on how to formulate optimization problems and use accessible tools like Gurobi to solve them. If you’re interested in diving deeper into the mathematical concepts, check out the Addendum section. However, this is not necessary for understanding how to use this notebook or Gurobi effectively!"
