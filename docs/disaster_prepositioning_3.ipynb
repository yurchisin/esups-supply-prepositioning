    "All the probabilities should sum up to one, i.e., $\\sum_k P^k = 1$. How do we calculate the probabilities though?

    "You may have noticed that every single disaster will have the same probability, or in other words, this will produce a uniform distribution. As a result, $P^k$ can effectively be removed from our objective function, so our new objective will give the exact same results as our old one. We'll talk about ways to potentially address this later on in the notebooks as an extension, but for the moment, the purpose of adding this is to show how easily the equation can be modified to be stochastic and to get users used to the idea.\n",

    "We've seen how the objective function uses the uniform distribution to solve the problem. But what if knowing that climate change is increasingly energizing large storms, we decide the past hurricane impacts aren't representative of what's to come? In this section we want to prompt you to come up with predictive elements to improve our models. Feel free to use some of the ideas below or go in an entirely new direction!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we encourage you to think creatively about enhancing predictive models for climate-related disasters. Consider how to incorporate novel data sources, feature engineering techniques, and model architectures to improve predictions. Below are some suggested approaches, but feel free to explore entirely new directions!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Study Focus: Coastal Eastern African Nations\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the disaster impact data for coastal Eastern African nations, can you develop a model to predict how these impacts might escalate for Madagascar in the coming years? Consider not only the historical data but also factors such as changes in sea surface temperatures, shifting storm tracks, population growth along vulnerable coastlines, and evolving infrastructure resilience. Further, can you integrate this predictive model into an optimization framework to better allocate resources for disaster preparedness and response?\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Approaches to Explore:\n",
    "- Comparing Time Series Models: Traditional statistical time series models like ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables) are commonly used to predict future values based on past data. How do these models compare with more advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) in capturing long-term dependencies, especially under non-stationary conditions induced by climate change?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporating Geospatial Data: Geospatial features, such as latitude, longitude, elevation, and proximity to bodies of water, can play a crucial role in predicting the impact of tropical storms. Can we encode geospatial information using techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, or leverage more specialized models such as Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to account for spatial dependencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporating Climate Change Projections: Beyond just historical data, consider how future climate projections can be integrated into the model. Can we use downscaled climate model outputs or ensemble approaches to account for different climate scenarios? How would these scenarios affect the frequency and intensity of tropical storms affecting coastal Eastern African nations?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Engineering with Climate Indicators: Introduce climate change indicators as predictive features. For example, how do trends in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases, or the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) correlate with storm intensification? Would incorporating these indicators as additional time series variables enhance predictive accuracy?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Hybrid and Ensemble Models: Can we leverage hybrid models that combine both statistical and deep learning approaches, or use ensemble methods that aggregate predictions from multiple models? For example, combining ARIMAX for short-term predictions with LSTM for capturing long-term trends may provide a more comprehensive forecasting tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimization Integration: Once a reliable predictive model is established, how can it be integrated into an optimization framework for resource allocation? For example, can we build an optimization model that minimizes both the cost of disaster preparedness and the potential loss from future storm impacts?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Explainability and Decision-Making: How can we ensure that the model is interpretable for decision-makers? Consider the use of techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain which factors contribute most to the model’s predictions, helping policymakers make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining predictive analytics with optimization, we can not only forecast future disaster impacts but also develop actionable strategies for minimizing those impacts. The goal is to make our models both more accurate and more useful in real-world applications, driving better outcomes for communities at risk.\n"

It might be a few hours faster to charter a jet to deliver blankets in the aftermath of a disaster, however, if it is 100x more expensive than by truck, that may constrain the organization from buying more blankets, chartering more trucks, or making it difficult to resupply for future disasters. So just as we solve for ways to minimize time, it can be important for firms with limited resources to make sure their money is being used to do the most good it can.\n",

Our time matrix, which we've been using to show how close or far buildings are from the disaster relief site, is just a set of predefined weights/discounts. So, if we change the numbers to reflect the cost of transit, then suddenly we're solving a cost-minimization problem! In fact, the substitution is so one-to-one, that besides switching $\\tau_{ij}$ for $c_{ij}$, we don't have to change the equation."

This can easily be represented as $y_{ir}^k$, let's explain what's happened. Before is $y$ was an array of length $K$ with each index holding sub array of length $I$ (which we could also write as size $K \\times I$), now each index in our subarrays also have an array of length $3$ to represent how much is sent via truck, plane, or boat.

    "### Enhancing System Performance with the Balance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "In humanitarian logistics, the efficiency of inventory allocation directly impacts the ability to respond swiftly and cost-effectively to disasters. The **Balance Metric** $(D)$ is a critical tool developed to evaluate the alignment of current inventory distribution with an optimal allocation. This metric is particularly valuable in contexts where multiple organizations independently manage inventory across various depots, without a centralized coordination mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition and Calculation of the Balance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance metric $(D)$ is defined as the ratio between the actual objective value (either cost or time) of the current inventory allocation $V(X)$ and the optimal objective value $V(A')$ given the same overall capacity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\frac{V(A)}{V(A')}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "-  $V(A)$: Represents the current system-wide cost or time to meet demand based on the existing inventory allocation \\(X\\).\n",
    "-  $V(A')$: Represents the minimized cost or time if the inventory were optimally distributed across all depots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of the Balance Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimal Inventory Allocation**:\n",
    "   The optimal value of $D$ is 1. This occurs when the current allocation perfectly aligns with the optimal allocation, meaning no further reallocation could reduce costs or response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying Imbalances**:\n",
    "   When $D > 1$, the system is considered \"out-of-balance.\" A value of 1.2, for example, implies that the current allocation incurs 20% higher costs or longer response times compared to an optimal arrangement. This indicates a potential for improvement by reallocating resources more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guiding System Improvements**:\n",
    "   The balance metric is not only an indicator of inefficiency but also a guide for decision-making. By identifying locations or items with the highest imbalance, decision-makers can prioritize inventory reallocations that would yield the most significant improvements in terms of cost savings or faster response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Applications in Humanitarian Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance metric offers several practical applications for optimizing humanitarian response efforts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategic Reallocation of Resources**:\n",
    "  Organizations can use the balance metric to identify under-stocked or over-stocked depots and adjust inventory levels accordingly. This strategic reallocation can significantly enhance response times or reduce costs, especially in multi-organizational contexts where coordination is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Network Changes**:\n",
    "  The balance metric is responsive to changes in the logistics network. For example, if a new depot is added in a high-risk area and remains under-stocked, the balance metric will reflect this imbalance, prompting an assessment of whether inventory should be redistributed to better leverage the new depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision-Making in Real-Time Operations**:\n",
    "  By continuously monitoring the balance metric as part of a real-time dashboard, operational managers can be alerted to changes that may impact overall system performance. This enables them to make data-driven decisions quickly, improving the overall resilience and responsiveness of the humanitarian supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the balance metric provides valuable insights into inventory allocation efficiency, it is important to consider its limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of Extreme Events**:\n",
    "  The balance metric can be influenced by extreme scenarios, such as very large-scale disasters that significantly impact the calculated demand. As a result, it should be interpreted alongside other metrics, such as the fraction of demand served ($g$) or the weighted fraction of disasters completely served ($d$), to provide a more comprehensive picture of system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependence on Data Quality and Model Assumptions**:\n",
    "  The accuracy of the balance metric depends on the quality of input data and the assumptions made in the model. Ensuring robust and accurate data collection processes and regularly updating model parameters to reflect real-world conditions are essential for maintaining the reliability of the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance metric $D$ offers a powerful tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of inventory allocation in humanitarian logistics. By identifying imbalances and guiding strategic reallocation decisions, this metric can help organizations optimize their response efforts, ensuring that resources are used most effectively to meet the needs of affected populations during disasters."
